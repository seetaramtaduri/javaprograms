Using Components
------------------------
In Java, every part of a GUI is represented by a class in the Swing package.
 JButton    class    for   buttons, 
 JWindow  class   for   windows, a
JTextField class   for   text fields

A component is an individual element in a user interface, such as a button or slider.

A container is a component that you can use to hold other components.

Windows and frames are containers that can be displayed in a user inter- face and hold other components. 

Windows are simple containers that do not have a title bar or any of the other buttons normally along the top edge of a GUI. 

Frames are windows that include all the common windowing fe tures users expect to find when they run software—such as buttons to close, expand, and shrink the window.

Create a subclass of JFrame
---------------------------------------

import javax.swing.*;
public class MainFrame extends JFrame {
public MainFrame() {
// set up the frame
}
}

A graphical user interface created with Swing can customize its appear-ance with a look and feel.

Java 7 introduces an enhanced look and feel called Nimbus .

You set a look and feel by calling the setLookAndFeel() method of the UIManager class in the main Swing
package.

The following statement sets Nimbus as the look and feel:

UIManager.setLookAndFeel( “com.sun.java.swing.plaf.nimbus.NimbusLookAndFeel” );

to create a Button
-------------------------
JButton okButton = new JButton( “OK”);
